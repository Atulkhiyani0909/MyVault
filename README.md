# üîí MyVault - A Secure, Client-Side Encrypted Password Manager

**MyVault** is a modern, secure password manager built with Next.js and designed with a **zero-knowledge security architecture**.  
All your sensitive data is encrypted and decrypted directly in your browser using a master password that is **never sent to the server**.

## üéØ Project Goal (MVP)

This project is a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** built to fulfill a specific set of requirements for a fast, simple, and privacy-first password vault.

The core goal was to build a web app where a user can:

- ‚úÖ Generate a strong, unique password with options for length, numbers, and symbols.  
- ‚úÖ Save credentials to a personal, client-side encrypted vault.  
- ‚úÖ Perform full **CRUD operations** (View, Edit, Delete) on saved entries.  
- ‚úÖ Search and filter the vault items.  

This implementation covers all *must-have* features, demonstrating the complete flow from **user sign-up ‚Üí generating ‚Üí saving ‚Üí searching ‚Üí editing ‚Üí deleting** a secure vault item.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Client-Side Encryption**: Data is encrypted with **AES** using your master password *before it ever leaves your device*.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Only you can decrypt your vault ‚Äî the server cannot access your sensitive data.  
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, view, edit, and delete entries.  
- **Built-in Password Generator**: Generate strong, unique passwords with customizable length and symbols.  
- **Secure Session Management**: Master password stored in `sessionStorage` for the session and cleared when you close the tab.  
- **Responsive & Modern UI**: Dark-themed, mobile-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS.
-  **Clipboard** : clipboard autoclear after 15 sec (time set is for 15sec for now )

## üîê Crypto Note
This project uses **CryptoJS (AES encryption)** for client-side encryption.  
It was chosen because of its simplicity, widespread adoption, and reliability for standard cryptographic operations ‚Äî making it ideal for a secure MVP.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

The **security of MyVault** is its most important feature. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **Master Password**  
   - When starting a session, the user enters a master password.  
   - This password is the **only key** that can decrypt your vault.

2. **In-Browser Encryption**  
   - Data is converted to a JSON object.  
   - Encrypted with **AES** using your master password.

3. **Encrypted Transmission**  
   - Only the **ciphertext** is sent to the server.  

4. **Secure Storage**  
   - Database stores only:  
     - Account email  
     - Entry title  
     - Encrypted payload (ciphertext)  
   - Sensitive data like **passwords, URLs, notes** are *never stored in plaintext*.  

5. **In-Browser Decryption**  
   - Encrypted data is fetched from the server.  
   - Decrypted locally in the browser with the master password.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: This security model relies on the app being served over **HTTPS**. Without SSL/TLS, attackers could intercept or alter JavaScript code.
